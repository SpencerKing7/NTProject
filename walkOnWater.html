                                </h2>
                                <p>Jesus had just finished feeding the 5000 people with five loaves of bread and two fish. After the meal, he told his disciples to get 
                                    into a boat and go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee while he went up on a mountain to pray. Later that night, the disciples 
                                    found themselves caught in a storm, with strong winds and waves buffeting their boat. In the midst of the storm, they saw Jesus 
                                    walking towards them on the water. Initially, they thought he was a ghost, but Jesus reassured them and invited Peter to come out 
                                    of the boat and walk on the water with him.
                                </p>
                                <p>My favorite part of this story is when Peter is asked to walk towards Jesus on the water. While he is on the water,
                                    the storms increase and he gets scared and sinks. But Jesus is instantly there, helping and lifting Peter out of the water.
                                    When we are focused on Christ, we can stay above the dark waters below. And in addition to that, when we start to sink He 
                                    is there to lift us up again. The most important part is to have faith in and trust in Him.
                                </p>
