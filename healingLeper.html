                                <p>During the time of Jesus, people with leprosy were generally considered outcasts and were forced to live in isolated communities 
                                    outside of cities and towns. Leprosy was a highly contagious disease, and people with the condition were believed to be unclean and 
                                    cursed by God. As a result, they were shunned by society and were not allowed to interact with others. Jesus is often depicted as 
                                    showing compassion for lepers and reaching out to them, despite the social stigma attached to the disease. In one notable story, 
                                    Jesus heals a group of lepers and tells them to go and show themselves to the priests, as required by Jewish law.
                                </p>
                                <p>Sometimes it might seem like we are so broken and wounded that we are past healing. Our differences and ailments can make us seem like
                                    outcasts in our community. I have felt that before. Jesus, like He did with the lepers, can heal us and help us feel loved and accepted
                                    even when others don't. I am grateful for His love and compassion that He shows to me and all of God's children.
                                </p>
